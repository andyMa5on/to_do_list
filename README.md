### **Creating a project**

There are two ways you can create your first project. Both options will open a modal for you to give your project a title.

1. On initially loading the page, if you have never created or deleted all projects the main section will appear with a few lines of text and a button asking you to create your first project.
2. Using the projects `button` to open the list of all your projects, once opened you will see a need add button to create a task.
