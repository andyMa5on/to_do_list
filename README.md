# ***Projects***

You can now create Projects. This new feature allows you to create multiple task lists for specific subjects.

## **Creating a project**

There are two ways you can create your first project. Both options will open a modal for you to give your project a title.

1. On initially loading the page, if you have never created or deleted all projects the main section will appear with a few lines of text and a button asking you to create your first project.

2. Using the projects `button` to open the projects menu, once opened you will see a new add button to create a project.

Once you have clicked either button a modal will appear where you can enter the project title. 

The final step is can be completed in a number of ways:

1. Use the bottom right `button` on the modal named "add"

2. Hit the enter key on your keyboard

3. If you would like to add more then one project press shift+enter. This will add your project and clear your project title so you can add your next one.

```
Note: Once you create a new project the UI will automatically update causing the following things to happen:

1. The projects menu will close
2. The newly created project will be loaded so you can start creating tasks
```



## ***Deleting a project***

If you no longer need a project, you can delete it using the following steps:

1. Open the projects side bar by clicking on the projects `button`

2. Find the project you would like to delete and click on the bin `SVG` located to the right of the project title.

3. A `Confirm` alert will appear to verify you wish to delete the project.

4. Select ok to confirm.

```
Note: If you delete a project it will be permanently removed, including all tasks inside.
```

## ***Changing between projects***

1. Open the projects side bar by clicking on the projects `button`

2. Select the project you wish to open by clicking on its name

## ***Re-naming a project***

## ***Creating a task***

Once you have created a project the next step is to start adding some tasks. This is achieved using the following steps:

2. Click on the add `button` which is located on the right hand side of the header.

3. A modal will now appear that is automatically focused on the task title `input`

At the End of each task item you will see you a `SVG` image of a bin. Clicking on this will active a `Confirm` alert to confirm you wish to delete the task.

```

```

## ***Completing a task***

At the beginning of each task you will see a `checkbox`. Clicking on this `checkbox` will mark the task as completed.
